> Algorithms and Data Structures project

## Description

Binary Search Tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.

## Usage


```java
# creating new tree
BST bst = new BST();

# inserting number 5 on tree.
bst.insert(5);

# deleting number 5 from tree.
bst.delete(5);
```
